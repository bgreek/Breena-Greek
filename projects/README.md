If you have files you would like to upload, follow these steps:

Make sure your files are organized in folders that have descriptive titles. For example, if you have files for two projects, you should split those files into two folders: one named "project_1" and another named "project_2."
Click the "Add file" button, then select "Upload files" from the dropdown menu.
Find and click on the folders you would like to upload and drag them into the window on the screen.
After you see the list of files that you uploaded, commit your changes. To do this, add the commit message: "Adding project files". Then, press the "Commit changes" button.
Now you'll add links to your new projects in your readme. To do this, navigate to the projects folder. Click the pencil icon to edit the README.md file.
Edit the README text so that it matches the names of your projects and their associated folders. This will create a link to your new project folder. For example, if your project was named "Hello World" and its files are in a folder named "hello_world", your readme would look like this:
# Projects

Scroll to the bottom of the page, type a commit message that describes the changes you made, then click the "Commit changes" button.
